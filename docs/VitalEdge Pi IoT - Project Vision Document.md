#### **Vision**

To create a modular, scalable, and secure IoT-based healthcare monitoring system that leverages edge computing through the Raspberry Pi. The system will:
1. **Collect Real-Time Health Metrics**: Capture data such as heart rate, temperature, oxygen levels, and other vital signs from connected wearable or environmental sensors.
2. **Provide Local Processing and Analysis**: Process data locally to ensure real-time responsiveness, conduct preliminary analytics, and trigger alerts based on threshold values.
3. **Enable Secure Data Transmission**: Ensure data security through HTTPS and planned encryption for all outgoing communication, with an option to retry failed transmissions.
4. **Support Integration with Backend and Aggregator**: Seamlessly integrate with the VitalEdge backend for data storage, management, and further analysis while supporting future integration with additional edge or cloud aggregators.

#### **Objectives**

1. **Robust Data Collection from Sensors**:
   - Establish stable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections to various sensors, including medical-grade or wearable sensors.
   - Enable multi-sensor support for data capture, including temperature, heart rate, oxygen levels, and environmental factors.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Local Storage**:
   - Implement preprocessing and filtering techniques for noise reduction, standardization, and preliminary validation.
   - Store data temporarily in SQLite for resilience, allowing for retry mechanisms and buffering when connectivity is unavailable.

3. **Event-Driven Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Detect and trigger alerts based on thresholds (e.g., abnormal heart rate or low oxygen levels) through lightweight local analytics.
   - Support a range of alert mechanisms, including triggering other IoT actuators, local notifications, and backend-integrated alerts.

4. **Optimized and Secure Data Transmission**:
   - Utilize HTTP or MQTT for data transfer to ensure compatibility with the VitalEdge backend.
   - Integrate HTTPS-based secure communication, with plans for potential end-to-end encryption.
   - Implement retry and resilience mechanisms for intermittent connectivity and logging of transmission attempts.

5. **Modularity and Extensibility**:
   - Ensure that the software design supports adding or removing sensors and integration points easily.
   - Design with an eye toward future IoT devices and scenarios, such as predictive analytics, telemedicine, or additional edge processing via systems like AWS Greengrass.
