### Recommended Raspberry Pi Board and Hardware for This Project

To transition from the emulator to a real Raspberry Pi board, it’s important to choose hardware that meets the requirements of the IoT Edge System. Here’s a comprehensive list of the recommended hardware:

---

### **1. Raspberry Pi Board**
#### **Recommended Model: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**
- **Reasons:**
  - High performance with a quad-core processor (1.5 GHz).
  - Available in 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB RAM variants. (Go for 4GB or 8GB for flexibility.)
  - USB 3.0 ports for high-speed connectivity.
  - Built-in Bluetooth 5.0 and dual-band Wi-Fi for seamless IoT integration.

#### **Alternative Models:**
- **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+** (cheaper, slightly less powerful, supports most of your project needs).

---

### **2. MicroSD Card**
- **Capacity:** 32GB or 64GB (Class 10 or higher for faster read/write speeds).
- **Recommendation:** SanDisk Extreme microSDXC.
- **Purpose:** To store the operating system, project files, and SQLite database.

---

### **3. Power Supply**
- **Recommendation:** Official Raspberry Pi USB-C Power Supply (5V/3A).
- **Purpose:** Ensures stable and adequate power for the Pi and connected peripherals.

---

### **4. Temperature Sensor**
#### **Govee Bluetooth Hygrometer Thermometer (ASIN: B08746Z6X3)**
- **Features:**
  - Measures temperature and humidity.
  - Communicates over Bluetooth.
  - Compatible with the bluepy library used in development.
- **Purpose:** For data collection in real-life scenarios.

---

### **5. Case and Heat Sinks**
- **Case:**
  - Official Raspberry Pi 4 Case or any case with proper ventilation.
- **Heat Sinks:**
  - Aluminum or copper heat sinks for CPU and RAM chips to prevent overheating.
- **Fan:**
  - Optional for long-duration operations or intensive workloads.

---

### **6. Connectivity Accessories**
- **HDMI Cable:**
  - Micro-HDMI to HDMI cable for connecting to a monitor for initial setup and debugging.
- **Monitor:**
  - Any monitor with an HDMI input.
- **Keyboard and Mouse:**
  - USB or Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for initial setup.

---

### **7. Additional Storage (Optional)**
- **USB Flash Drive or SSD (Optional):**
  - For expanding storage, backing up data, or storing larger datasets.

---

### **8. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Setup**
- Built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on Raspberry Pi 4 are sufficient.
- **Optional Dongle:**
  - If extra Bluetooth or Wi-Fi range is needed, consider USB dongles.

---

### **9. GPIO Accessories**
- **GPIO Header Pins:**
  - Pre-soldered GPIO headers on the Raspberry Pi board.
- **Jumper Wires and Breadboard:**
  - For testing additional sensors (e.g., GPIO-connected temperature or pressure sensors).

---

### **10. Additional Sensors (Optional for Future Expansion)**
- **DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Temperature Sensor:**
  - Connects via GPIO pins for highly accurate temperature readings.
- **Pulse Sensor:**
  - For measuring heart rate via GPIO or Bluetooth.
- **DHT22 Sensor:**
  - Measures both temperature and humidity.

---

### **11. Optional Peripherals**
- **Camera Module:**
  - Official Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 for capturing images or video.
- **Battery Pack:**
  - Portable power bank for off-grid testing and portability.

---

### **Summary Checklist**
